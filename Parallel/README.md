# Parallel

A repo for parallel English/Tibetan corpora compiled by Esukhia

The folder "84000" is a work in progress. It contains all the English and Tibetan sub-sections of the Translated Words that have been done thus far. The have had some basic pre-processing (automatic alignment by sentence), but require more steps to be actually aligned in parrallel. This README will be updated once that's completed...
