The "Readability" folder of the Nanhai Corpus Github repo contains a series frequency lists for use in the TibEditor (or educators, writers, or students who wish to use them manually). 

January 2017: 9 lists of rough-draft data were added for basic editor testing purposes: General_Level_1-3 (based on a mix of all data), Speech_Level_103 (for spoken), and Writing (for written). 

January 2017: A master "GSL" (General Service List) of the most frequent 300 headwords in a balanced corpus (50% speech, based on all Nanhai's speech files; 50% written, based on a sample-sized 25% of Modern & 25% Middle); the final list, including all word forms, totals 533 words.
