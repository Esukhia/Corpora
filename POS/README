This is a simplified scheme, POS-tagged version of SOAS's Digital communication corpus: larkpie.net/tibetancorpus/ 

The simplified POS tags used adhere to POS (Part of Speech) tags set out by UD (Universal Dependencies): http://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html 

They are given Tibetan-ized, two-character codes as follows: 

POS CODE	UD universal code
MQ	NOUN: noun
MK	PROPN: proper noun
MC	PRON: pronoun
JC	VERB: verb
JR	AUX: auxiliary
GC	ADJ: adjective
NC	ADV: adverb
TL	ADP: adposition
TE	DET: determiner
TT	CCONJ: coordinating conjunction
	SCONJ: subordinating conjunction
TX	PART: particle
AD	NUM: numeral
BD	INTJ: interjection
KX	X: other
CX	PUNCT: punctuation
	SYM: symbol
  
Two codes do not occur in Tibetan: 
SYM: symbol (beyond punctuation, symbols -- like emoticons, dollar signs, etc. -- simply don't occur in traditional Tibetan text, as defined by UD)
SCONJ: subordinating conjunction (b/c we aren't yet convinced Tibetan uses subordinating conjunctions, but instead uses a combination of coordinating conjunctions, separate sentences, and/or adpositional phrases that can act as subordinating conjunctions)

Also included are the regex substitution lists for converting between POS schemes (the full, complex SOAS scheme - our own simplified scheme - the UD equivalents to the simplified scheme).
